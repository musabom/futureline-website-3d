# Deployment

Production runs on a self-managed VPS (`futureline.ai`). nginx terminates TLS
on 443 and reverse-proxies to the Next.js server on `127.0.0.1:5000`, which is
kept alive by PM2.

> This project was previously hosted on Replit. The `.replit` file and the
> Replit references in `replit.md` are historical and no longer used.

## Routine deploy

From the app directory on the server:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

That fetches `origin/main`, installs dependencies, syncs the database schema,
builds, reloads PM2, and health-checks the result. It prints a rollback command
if the health check fails. Pass a branch name to deploy something other than
`main` (e.g. `./deploy.sh feat/legal-pages`).

**`--legacy-peer-deps` is required, not optional.** The project pins React
18.3.1 while `@react-three/fiber@9` and `@react-three/drei@10` declare a React
19 peer, so a plain `npm ci` fails to resolve.

---

## First-time setup

### 1. Requirements

- Node.js 20+ and npm
- PostgreSQL 16 (local or managed)
- nginx with a TLS certificate for `futureline.ai`
- PM2 (`npm install -g pm2`)

### 2. Environment

Create `.env` in the app directory. It is gitignored — **never commit it**, and
never put credentials in `replit.md`, this file, or any other tracked file.

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@127.0.0.1:5432/futureline?schema=public"

# Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="<random-32-byte-secret>"
SESSION_SECRET="<random-32-byte-secret>"

NEXTAUTH_URL="https://futureline.ai"
APP_URL="https://futureline.ai"
NODE_ENV="production"

# Transactional email
RESEND_API_KEY="<resend-api-key>"
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="noreply@futureline.ai"

# Google sign-in (optional — the button degrades gracefully when unset)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="<client-id>.apps.googleusercontent.com"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="<client-secret>"
```

### 3. First boot

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flservicesai-bit/futureline-website-3d.git
cd futureline-website-3d
# create .env as above, then:
npm ci --legacy-peer-deps
npx prisma db push
npm run seed          # ONLY on a fresh database — creates dev accounts
npm run build
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
pm2 save && pm2 startup   # survive reboots
```

`npm run seed` inserts throwaway accounts with weak passwords. Run it only on
an empty database, and change those passwords immediately if you do.

### 4. nginx

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name futureline.ai www.futureline.ai;

    # ssl_certificate / ssl_certificate_key managed by certbot

    client_max_body_size 50M;   # the /lab video-effects upload cap

    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:5000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_read_timeout 120s;   # ffmpeg jobs on /lab can be slow
    }
}
```

`X-Forwarded-For` matters: the rate limiter keys on it, and the password-reset
flow falls back to the request host when `APP_URL` is unset.

## Things to know

### URLs are locale-prefixed

English lives at `/en/*`, Arabic at `/ar/*`. Unprefixed URLs redirect
(`/courses` → `/en/courses`), so old inbound links keep working.

This is deliberate: `localePrefix: 'as-needed'` triggers an infinite redirect
loop on next-intl 4.13.x + Next 15.5.12 (the default-locale response carries a
rewrite *and* a self-redirect), which took the whole English site down. See the
note in `src/i18n/routing.ts`. Revisit once that upstream bug is fixed. Consider
making the redirects permanent (308) for SEO.

### Database migrations

`deploy.sh` runs `prisma db push`, which is additive and a no-op when the
schema already matches. For destructive changes (dropped or renamed columns),
back up first:

```bash
pg_dump -Fc futureline > backup-$(date +%F).dump
```

### Rollback

```bash
git reset --hard <previous-sha>
npm ci --legacy-peer-deps && npm run build && pm2 reload futureline
```

### Logs

```bash
pm2 logs futureline --lines 100
pm2 status
```

### Secrets hygiene

An admin password was once committed to `replit.md` in this public repo. The
history has been rewritten to remove it, but **orphaned commits remain
retrievable by direct SHA until GitHub garbage-collects them**, so any
credential ever committed must be treated as compromised and rotated. Keep
secrets in `.env` on the server only.

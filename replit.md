## User Model
- Uses separate `firstName` and `lastName` fields (not a single `name` field)
- Auth session provides computed `name` (firstName + lastName) for backward compatibility

## User Roles
- **ADMIN**: Full system control, access to /admin portal
- **INSTRUCTOR**: Manage assigned courses, upload lessons
- **CUSTOMER**: Browse, purchase, access courses, track progress

## Seed Data Credentials
- Admin: musabalsabahi@hotmail.com / [REMOVED-ROTATE-THIS-PASSWORD]
- Instructor: instructor@futureline.com / instructor123
- Customer: customer@futureline.com / customer123

## Lead Model
- Uses separate `firstName` and `lastName` fields (not a single `name` field)
- `tourType` field serves as general "interest/topic" across all forms (optional, defaults to "General Enquiry")
- Leads come from multiple sources: FL Tourism, FL Courses, FL Services
- Migration script at `prisma/migrate-leads.ts` handles splitting old `name` data on deployment

## Business Divisions
- **FL Tourism**: Live - Standalone tourism page at /tourism (contact form with firstName/lastName)
- **FL Courses**: Live - Full course catalog, free enrollment, lesson viewer, enquiry form for custom courses
- **FL Services**: Live - Digitalisation service at /services/digitalisation, enquiry form for all services
- **FL AI & Automation**: Hidden (Coming Soon) - Page code preserved at /ai, redirects to home, removed from nav/footer

## Configurable Settings (Admin UI)
- **Brand Settings** (/admin/brand): Company name, tagline, colors, logo, contact emails
  - `contactEmail`: Used on Services, Digitalisation, and AI pages (default: flservices.ai@gmail.com)
  - `tourismEmail`: Used on FL Tourism page (default: authentic.tour.om@gmail.com)
  - Brand utility at `src/lib/brand.ts` with `getBrandSettings()` helper
  - Public API at `/api/brand` serves contact emails (no auth required)

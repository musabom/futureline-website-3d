/**
 * GlobeHero — the hero section.
 *
 * Server rendered on purpose: the headline, tagline and sub-copy are in the
 * HTML, so they are the LCP element and are visible to crawlers. Only the
 * <Canvas> underneath is client-only.
 *
 * Layers, back to front: aurora glow → WebGL globe → perspective grid floor →
 * copy. The 3 "what we do" chips that used to float here (absolutely
 * positioned, overlapping the globe) moved to their own ServiceHighlights
 * section right after this one, by request — the hero now carries only the
 * headline/CTAs, no card content layered on top of it.

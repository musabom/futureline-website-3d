/**
 * AmbientMesh — the light page's atmosphere: a soft gradient wash, three
 * drifting colour orbs, and a faint tech grid that fades out down the page.
 *
 * Mounted inside the page rather than the layout, so it can't paint over
 * /courses, /admin or any surface that is still dark. Purely decorative and
 * inert — no pointer events, aria-hidden, and the drift is CSS-only so it
 * costs nothing on the main thread and stops under reduced motion.

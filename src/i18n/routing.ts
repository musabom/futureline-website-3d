/**
 * Locale routing.
 *
 * localePrefix: 'as-needed' is deliberate. English keeps unprefixed URLs
 * (/courses, /services/...) and Arabic is purely additive at /ar/*.
 * Switching to an always-prefixed scheme would move every existing URL and
 * require a redirect map to avoid losing search rankings and breaking
 * inbound links.
 *
 * Note: bilingual support was removed at one point and then restored by
 * request — see the git history around "remove Arabic/bilingual support"
 * and its revert if any Arabic-specific asset looks unexpectedly missing.

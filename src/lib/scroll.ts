/**
 * Lands on `hash` and keeps it there while the page finishes settling.
 *
 * Two problems make a single jump unreliable when arriving from another page:
 *
 *  1. The target may not exist yet. The home page streams in, and its 3D hero
 *     and lazy scenes can take seconds to mount, so we wait for the element
 *     rather than assuming it's there.
 *  2. Once it exists, the position keeps moving as those scenes mount, and
 *     Next.js applies its own scroll restoration after the navigation — which
 *     was leaving visitors ~2400px short of the section.
 *
 * So: phase one waits for the element, phase two re-scrolls until the section
 * actually sits under the header. Aborts as soon as the visitor scrolls
 * themselves — yanking the page back under someone who has taken over is
 * worse than landing in the wrong place.
